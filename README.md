# odin-recipes
Project Recipe from Odin Project

A website with a home page that leads to three other pages with good recipes that I bet you would like to try. The purpose of this project is practice and test my html5 and css3 skills. In the end of the project I will do a list of things I have learned during this project. 

I hope you like it !
