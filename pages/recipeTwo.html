    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Let's agree that brigadeiro is unanimous when the subject is sweet, because there is nothing more Brazilian than
        a good brigadeiro. Some places in Brazil call the candy <em>negrinho</em>, but the name brigadeiro wins by far.
        And the history of this candy is very peculiar. The chocolate balls were first made in Rio de Janeiro, for
        parties that raised money for Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes' candidacy for the presidency in 1946. Although he lost
        the elections to Eurico Gaspar Dutra, he won a sweet homage
